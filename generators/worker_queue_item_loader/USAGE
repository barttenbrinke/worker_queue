Description:
---

  The 'worker_queue_item_loader' generator creates stubs for a new worker_queue_item
  loader.

  The generator takes the loader's name as its argument. The loader's name may be
  given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Loader'.

  The generator creates a loader class in lib/worker_queue dir.

Example:
---

  ./script/generate worker_queue_item_loader Misc::UpdateSessionTicket
  ./script/generate worker_queue_item_loader misc/update_session_ticket

  Both of the above would create the same loader at: 

  - lib/worker_queue/misc/update_session_ticket_loader.rb
