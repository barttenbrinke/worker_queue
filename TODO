The following things need to be done:

- Maximum parallalization
    WorkerQueue now does either parallel or sequential execution.
    A maximum amount of parallel running Workers per class_name would be nice.
    For example: a user can have a maximum of 5 reports running in parallel.
    
- Spec suite
    The specs only run in a rails project with the WorkerQueue, rspec and rspec_on_rails plugins installed.

- USAGE
    Check if examples actually work.
