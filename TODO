The following things need to be done:

- Named finders
    Just adding a named finder causes problems with un-initialized WorkerQueueClass attributes.
    This needs an elegant solution.
    
- Maximum parallalization
    WorkerQueue now does either parallel or sequential execution.
    A maximum amount of parallel running Workers per class_name would be nice.
    For example: a user can have a maximum of 5 reports running in parallel.
